{"body": "Yes, I did.  I smoked for 15 years.  Mostly I smoked around a pack a day, but for a while I was up to almost 2 packs, then it tapered down to where a single pack would last me nearly 3 days, but I just couldn't manage to completely kick the habit.  A coworker told me that her husband, a smoker of 37 years, had quit by using Zyban for just 3 weeks.  That sounded pretty promising, so I gave it a try.  Now, my insurance company wouldn't cover Zyban, but they did  cover Wellbutrin (it's the exact same chemical - bupropion), so my doc wrote me a scrip for Wellbutrin.  3 weeks later I was smoke free.
