yay. ^_^ i have a lot of hopes for escitalopram, i think it'll be the ssri that works well for me. so i really want to be able to take it.

i was thinking of being on 2.5 for 4 days, then going up to 5mg for a week or two, before going to 10.  i dunno, i try to be careful but i've been on other ssris, and some of them, like paroxetine, i was put right on 10mg, no taper (was forced in mental hospital).  no bad side effects, really surprising/lucky lol.
