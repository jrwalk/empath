Recently I started taking Wellbutrin in the morning, and holy shit. I haven't felt this good in a really long time. Things dont bother me nearly as much, and I'm 100X more productive. I dont have trouble getting out of bed in the morning anymore and I'm actually eager to go about my day, a feeling I haven't had in months.  I don't even really know why I'm posting this, I guess I'm just so psyched about this that I wanted to share it with you guys. Does anyone here take Wellbutrin or previously taken it? I feel great, but I'm slightly worried about the long list of side effects. Thoughts?\""

THE PLAN IS TO LOWER THE DOSAGE OF ESCITALOPRAM AND TRY TO TAKE IT OFF ENTIRELY AT SOME POINT, BUT IT'S A SLOW PROCESS AND IT'LL MEAN GOING THROUGH WITHDRAW, WHICH.. IS GOING TO BE A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS OF STRUGGLING AGAINST NAUSEA AND UNSTABLE MOOD, AND TRY TO SEE IF THE OTHER MEDICINE I TAKE CAN TAKE OVER. MEDICINE FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SADLY INVOLVES A LOT OF TRYING AND FAILURE.\\n\\nI HAVE ANOTHER DOCTOR, WHO IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE HORMONAL ISSUE, BUT SO FAR THE MEDICINE GIVEN ISN'T REALLY HELPING. IT DOESN'T HELP THAT THE DOCTOR INSISTS ON SUBJECTS I'M ALREADY BOTHERED WITH, WITH THINGS I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO - SHE FOCUSES ON MY WEIGHT RATHER THAN THE HORMONAL IMBALANCE, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO LOSE IN MY CURRENT CONDITION. I TRIED EXPLAINING THAT BUT SHE KEEPS TRYING TO PUSH ME TO GO OUT AND WALK, AND CURRENTLY, WHEN I TRY TO DO THAT I PANIC. SOME DAYS I MANAGE TO GO OUT A LITTLE. MOST OF THE DAYS I'M TOO SCARED, BUT SHE KEPT TALKING LIKE I WAS SIMPLY UNWILLING TO DO IT AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY OPEN UP AND SPEAK TO HER. SHE ALSO INSISTS ON ME MAKING A DIET THAT INVOLVES... BASICALLY CUTTING OFF MEAT, WHICH I LOVE, AND SUBSTITUTING FOR FISH, WHICH... I HONESTLY CAN'T STAND, AND I'VE TRIED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.\\n\\nI TRIED TO SAY THAT. IT'S NOT A DEFICIENCY OF ANY OF THE THINGS FISH GIVES, BECAUSE I TAKE CARE OF THAT PART WITH SUPPLEMENTS, SO I HOPED SHE COULD ACTUALLY HELP ME FIND A DIET I COULD CONCEIVABLY DO, BUT IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME AT ALL. SO, MOSTLY I'M TRYING TO IMPROVISE, BY CUTTING CARBS, SUGARS, AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND TRYING TO EAT LESS AND SLOWER.\\n\\nMOSTLY IT FEELS LIKE I'M UP FOR A VERY LONG YEAR, WHERE VERY LITTLE CHANGES EVEN THOUGH I'M TRYING. IT'S LIKE THERE'S A WALL AND I CAN'T GET PAST IT.\""
