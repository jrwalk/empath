      <h3>empath: extracting smarter sentiments for antidepressants</h3>

      <p>Starting antidepressants can be scary, both from symptoms and from side 
      effects.  This can be all the worse in the first few weeks, particularly 
      if you need to try several different medications before finding one that works.</p>

      <p>It can be easy to feel alone when dealing with depression.  But others 
      are going through the same as you - understanding what they're feeling and how they're 
      reacting can be a powerful thing.</p>

      <p>By extracting conversations on antidepressants from social users on 
      <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit.com</a>, this app shares 
      sentiments and understanding on antidepressant usage based on keywords for 
      characterizing conversation topics, analysis of positive & negative sentiments 
      expressed in comments, and even recommendations for likely successful 
      alternate medications.</p>

      <h3>methods</h3>

      <p>The app implements three major components: keyword conversation 
      characterization, sentiment analysis, and the recommender system.</p>

      <p>Keyword sets are generated based on filtering via term frequency-inverse 
      document frequency (TF-IDF).  TF-IDF scoring is based on how frequently a 
      word (more properly, a lemma, or word processed down to its base, without 
      any attached grammatical information) appears in the target text (the term 
      frequency).  This score is then normalized by how frequently a word appears 
      in similar texts, to account for words that are common across the board in 
      related documents (and therefore aren't useful to characterize a particular 
      text).  This app scores the TF against an IDF calculated on unrelated web 
      comments - thus, finding words that are common in comments discussing 
      antidepressants, <i>and uncommon in other web comments.</i></p>

      <p>Sentiment scores are calculated using the recursive neural net (RNN) method
      implemented in the  <a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">Stanford 
      CoreNLP</a> toolkit.  This allows the sentiment analyzer to account for 
      semantic relationships between words, rather than simply tallying the sentiment 
      score based on single-word occurrences.  The RNN method operates on parsed 
      semantic structures mapping sentences into trees - this also allows sentiment 
      scoring to be applied to subsections of sentences talking about particular drugs, 
      as the sentiment score is recursively applied to every node in the tree.</p>

      <p>The recommender system is based on simple logic rules, tracking the new 
      medications mentioned subsequently by users of the input drug (assuming 
      conversations are laid out chronologically).  This is then filtered by a 
      check that the expressed sentiment improved with the new drug, indicating 
      that the switch was positive for that user.</p>

      <p>The app reports these in a clean, visually-intuitive manner, showing the 
      sentiment score for the chosen drug compared to the database average, a word 
      bubbler for conversation topics, a switch recommendation, and a sample of 
      processed reddit comments (ranked by score normalized to subreddit population 
      to account for different topical forum sizes).</p>
